# Mercari Euro Hack 2018

## Project Description

We would like to develop a peer-2-peer based courier service to let users items to be delivered on their behalf by other users. As an inherent part of a daily routine it would allow users monetise their travel time whilst commuting to work/school/gym/ frequently visited places. By the means of delivering items on someone else's behalf we incentivise users to sell more as they won’t waste their time on dispatching parcels/meeting other users in person. That will heavily improve user experience and encourage even the busiest ones to trade online whilst involving people having more time to sort the delivery part for them. By introducing the feedback and user rating system we ensure to maintain good level of trust. Courier profile analysis using basic machine learning techniques, and blockchain, to make sure that any package won’t get lost in journey.
